        <li>1.5 cups of all-purpose flour, and more for dusting</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of kosher salt</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> 
            Gather the ingredients
        </li>
        <li>
            Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with 2 inches of salted water.
            Bring water to a boil over a high head; reduce the heat to a medium-high and let simmer undisturbed until potatoes are tender but still firm, roughly 25 to 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li> 
            Drain the water from the saucepan and let the potatoes dry and cool for 5 to 10 minutes</li>
        <li>
            Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel potatoes and pass the peeled potatoes through a ricer into a large bowl
        </li>
        <li> 
            Fold in flour, egg, and salt until flour is incorporated and dough starts to hold together.
            Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and gently knead once or twice until mostly smooth (DO NOT overwork)
        </li>
        <li>Divide dough into 4 even portions. 
            Roll and shape each of the portions into long tubes about 3/4 inch in diameter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut the tubes into 1/2 inch long pieces
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring a large bot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat.
            Drop the gnocchi in and cook for 3 to 4 minutes until the gnocchi have risen to the top.
            Transfer cooked gnocchi to the desired sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve and Enjoy!
